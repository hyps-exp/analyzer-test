#
# RUN LIST (YAML format)
#
# The allowed keys are
#   unit   <- dividing event unit
#   bin    <- path to executable binary
#   conf   <- path to conf file from the work directory
#   data   <- path to data directory/file
#   root   <- path to the output root file directory/file
#
# Be careful of the indent rule because YAML format is sensitive to it.
# Some problems will happen if there is no default setting declaration.

# work directory path
# The following paths must be relative to this path

# default setting
# default setting MUST have all items.
# This setting will be inherited unless you explicitly set values for the individual cases.

# If you want to adapt the default setting to some runs,
# you only have to list keys.
