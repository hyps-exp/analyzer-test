# RUN LIST (YAML format)
#
# The allowed keys are
#   queue  <- bsub queue (eg. s, l, etc...)
#   unit   <- dividing event unit
#   nporc  <- number of process for merging (must be less than 20)
#   buff   <- intermediate root files will be placed here if nproc is more than 2
#   bin    <- path to executable binary
#   conf   <- path to conf directory/file from the work directory
#   data   <- path to data directory/file
#   root   <- path to the output ROOT output directory/file
#
# Be careful of the indent rule because YAML format is sensitive to it.
# Some problems will happen if there is no default setting declaration.
#

#____________________________________________________
# work directory path
# The following paths must be relative to this path

WORKDIR: ~/E70analyzer/offline-analyzer-191123/

#____________________________________________________
# default setting
# default setting MUST have all items.
# This setting will be inherited unless you explicitly set values for the individual cases.

DEFAULT:
  queue: s
  unit:  50000
  nproc: 1
  buff:  ./grouproot/buffer
  bin:   ./bin/HodoAFT
  conf:  ./param/conf/analyzer_e70.conf
  data:  ./data/run01037.dat.gz
  root:  ./grouproot

#____________________________________________________
# Individual settings
# If you want to adapt the default setting to some runs,
# you only have to list keys.

RUN:

  HodoAFT: # Any keys are OK unless it overlaps.
    bin:  ./bin/HodoAFT
    conf: ./param/conf/analyzer_e70.conf
#   root: ./test.root
